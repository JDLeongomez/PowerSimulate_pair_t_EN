## Paired *t*-test
<br>
Power analysis based on the simulation of a population, and the probability of obtaining a significant result with a sample of a given size.
Although more direct tools for power analysis exist for *t*-tests, this application relies on simulations to illustrate the concept of statistical power.

<hr>

This app is available from my (rather slow) personal [Shiny server](https://shiny.jdl-svr.lat/PowerSimulate_ind_t_EN/). However, if that is too slow or my server is not working, you can always run it locally in your computer with R installed. 

To do this, you can simply run the code below in R:

```R
library(shiny)
runGitHub("PowerSimulate_pair_t_EN", "JDLeongomez")
```
